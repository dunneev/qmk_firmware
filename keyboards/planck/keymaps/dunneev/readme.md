# Evan's Planck Layout

<<<<<<< HEAD
If in doubt, use the latest rev.
=======
workhorse.json is the keymap created in the qmk online configurator.

dunneev is that layout modified with additional features (like tap dance), along with some necessary key adjustments (like changing MO calls from qmk configurator to RAISE & LOWER). 

When in doubt, use the latest rev firmware.
